          <p>We collaborate with the utility on phased power delivery that matches the build schedule. Our facilities are engineered for efficiency so non computing energy use is kept low. Sabey sites achieve strong PUE and routinely earn ENERGY STAR scores in the high nineties.</p>
          <p>Backup generators support resiliency. Fuel is stored and maintained under safety standards. In a typical year, run hours are limited.</p>

          <p>We select cooling technology by climate and sustainability goals. For Indianapolis we plan a closed loop system that uses virtually no water during normal operation while keeping energy use acceptable.</p>
          <p>Across markets many facilities are waterless or closed loop. Where water is used, reclaimed or recycled sources can be used when available. Studies in major markets show water use comparable to large offices.</p>
